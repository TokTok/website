An update has been pushed to the Google Play Alpha Testing Group with a brand-spankin' new APK.

This update focuses more on aesthetics, with most changes relating to animation-smoothing, notification polishing, and ActionBar backward compatibility. Delivery and read receipts were also added, but will receive a face-lift very shortly. To those who may experience Antox crashing when selecting a friend, re-installing the app will usually fix the problem. If not, please open an issue on GitHub and we'll get it sorted out.

A new permission (Android.VIBRATE) has been added. You will have to manually update the app through Google Play, as permission changes, no matter how minor, require your approval. This permission was necessary, as notifications now have permission to vibrate your phone when the screen is off.

Thanks for being apart of the Alpha Test Group, your feedback is always appreciated.
