Just a quick post, we've finally got Antox working on[ Jenkins](http://http://jenkins.tox.im/job/Android-Antox).

Antox downloads from our [download.tox.im](http://download.tox.im "download.tox.im") site are now built up to the commit, with no more than a 10 minute delay after irungentoo or Astonex push a commit.

Also note that the gplay signing key is going to change, and will share one with the Jenkins build.

The latest Antox apk is also always available [here](https://c1cf.https.cdn.softlayer.net/80C1CF/192.254.75.110:8080/job/Android-Antox/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/antox.apk).

Note: I _just_ noticed [this.](https://blog.libtoxcore.so/141/antox-nightly-builds-google-play-store)
