As we've hit the deadline for student applications, I thought I'd take a moment to share the outcome.

For 2014, Google accepted 190 organizations, with 4420 students sending in 6313 proposals. This means that on average a random organization received around 33 proposals, if divided evenly. This means that on average, each org would receive around 0.5% of all proposals.

Now, the number of proposals being divided equally does not happen, some organizations might be more known, some might have few areas to do proposals, others might be umbrellas.

Project Tox received 88 proposals, meaning over 1.39% of all proposals were sent to us. As Project Tox is a bit of an umbrella, students applied to one of 6 major categories; being Core, AV, Qt, Venom, iOS, and Android. Stats on where proposals went have yet to be calculated, though a good majority went to Android and Qt.

This rush of students was surprisingly successful, for our first GSoC, I can't wait to see what good comes out of the chosen students, and what comes out of future summers.
