Let's just rename this blog to the Antox development blog.

Antox 0.6.5 is out and, like yesterday, with only minor changes that are mostly cosmetic. The total changes are:

*   Change receipt icons to something less arbitrary
*   Updated Italian translation
*   Updated German translation
*   Add Turkish translation
*   Timestamps of messages now update based on the local time of your device
*   Antox now waits to fully load the database information before accepting input. This may result in about a 1 second delay in starting the app, but it prevents force closing by a user interacting too quickly.
*   Deleted chat threads are now removed from the interface immediately
That's it for today! Unfortunately, Google's Developer Console seems to be down so it might take awhile. If you want to see the changes immediately without having to wait, you can download the[ APK here.](http://vexx.us/Clients/Antox/antox-0.6.5.apk) The update is signed with the same keys used for Google Play, which means it can't be spoofed.
