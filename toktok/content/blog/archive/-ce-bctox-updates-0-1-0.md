**New features:**

*   Ability to start sending video (one way) during an audio call, or stop sending video during a video call
*   Playing 2 channel audio (note: uTox does not currently support sending 2 channel audio, only receiving)
*   These changes break compatibility with older clients
**Bugfixes:**

*   Windows XP fixes: uTox should now work on Windows XP
*   Audio playback fixes for Android
*   Fixed a number of segfaults/crashes (mostly Linux-exclusive)
*   Fixed flickering on Linux when resizing the window ([contribution by mk21](https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/pull/175))
*   Fixed an issue with the red and blue channels being swapped on inline images
**Other:**

*   The uTox Updater for Windows has been updated and now has a GUI (the updater has a self update feature and should automatically update itself, please report any issues related to the updater)
