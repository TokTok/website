With our main developer, Astonex out on vacation for this week, not many changes have been made since yesterday. Those currently enrolled in the ATG will be receiving 0.6.4 with two small, cosmetic changes within the next few hours. These changes include:

*   A fix on the timestamp not appearing in the ChatFragment (pull out menu, where your contacts are)
*   Adding a missing space in the dialog window when you long-press a contact
*   Happy (An)Toxing! As always, your feedback is welcomed.
