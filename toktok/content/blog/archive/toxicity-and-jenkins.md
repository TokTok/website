The main Toxicity dev has finally finished with some personal stuff and is back to working on Toxicity, rather than merging a bunch of pull requests! Along with that the Jenkins build for Toxicity is working perfectly, thanks to stqism (Sean) and stal for their work on that.

Along with some recent commits, a few big issues were resolved, including updating core and fixing some PR bugs. Hopefully there'll be more in the future. A little bird hinted to me something about background threading...
