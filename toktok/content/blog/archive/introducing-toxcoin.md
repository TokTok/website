A new cryptocurrency to solve the issues tox has.

<!-- more -->

The main issues Tox face are that since we do not have central servers things 
like making multiple devices have the same "account" and offline messaging is 
very difficult. For this reason we have searched long and hard for a real 
decentralized solution to these problems. We are proud to announce today that 
we have found such a solution. This solution also has far reaching applications 
and could also for example enable the creation of more efficient crypto 
currencies and solve world hunger.

So how does it work? First we define proof of trust as the amount of trust that 
can be proven a node has in a distributed peer to peer network. The trust a 
node has in the system is defined as the inverse of the non trust a node has in 
the system. Trusted nodes are assumed to always behave correctly meaning 
untrusted nodes will not behave correctly. By making each node look for nodes 
that do not behave correctly non trusted nodes can therefore be identified and 
disposed of by the network. This leaves a network that only contains trusted 
nodes. Once a network is certain to contain only trusted nodes any system which 
requires such a system can easily be implemented on top meaning it is possible 
to implement every centralized system in an efficient decentralized manner.

Creating a decentralized internet will therefore be possible. The possibilities 
are endless. With this revolutionary new technology anybody will be capable of 
having their own website.

Why name this technology toxcoin? The best way to get this technology up and 
running fast and to fund development is to make it its own crypto currency.
Toxcoin will also be used to fund development of Tox. Tox developers will be 
payed in Toxcoins which will increase in value as more and more people used 
Tox. If we assume a total market cap of 1 million toxcoin and assume each tox 
user is worth 10$. When Tox reaches 1 billion users each toxcoin will be worth 
10000$. Toxcoins are clearly an investment that will only grow in value. 
Investing in this con will truly increase your money.

Is this an altcoin? No, toxcoin will be implemented using the bitcoin 
blockchain as a base.

There is already some proof of concept code in the github repo but it is still
in very early stages.
