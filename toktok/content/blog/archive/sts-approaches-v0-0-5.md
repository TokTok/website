After a little more than week of work, the STS is rapidly approaching a first draft. Standards such as DNS Discovery and the URI standard have been set, and naming schemes of often used protocols such as the Tox Network have been established. We're always looking for criticism, so all input is welcomeâ€”even grammar corrections.

You can check out the current revision of the STS on our [Tox/STS GitHub repo](https://github.com/Tox/STS/blob/master/STS.md).
