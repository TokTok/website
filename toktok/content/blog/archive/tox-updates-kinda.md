Well folks, here we are, a blog post in what seems like forever.

Now, if you're following the project off our blog and twitter, don't get discouraged, we're still alive and well, busily working away.

So, if you haven't heard we introduced a site called [https://toxme.se](https://toxme.se "https://toxme.se"), a fast and easy way to share your ID with your friends. It's as simple as punching in an ID, selecting a name, and getting a name like joe@toxme.se. Now I know what you may be wondering, isn't this controlling in some sense? To correctly answer that we'll have to look at how it works. The website is an extension of the DNS Discovery standard, a method for storing keys in DNS records, usually encrypted to prevent spoofing and mitm attacks. The way this works is that you can take your domain like cats.com and make your own sarah user, so all your friends can add you by adding sarah@cats.com, we've just gone ahead and setup a site to make it easy.

Now, toxme isn't new, we introduced it a few weeks back, but never formally announced its arrival. If you signed up back then keep in mind, a few weeks back we did wipe all the records as we moved to an encrypted format, so your entry may no longer exist.

Now, I know what you're thinking, that can't be all they've done, right?

Right!, but we want to keep a good bit of it a surprise, so hold on to your horses for a few more days, this is going to be big.

Happy Toxxing,

Sean
