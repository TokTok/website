Howdy folks, I feel like it's a good time to get you all up to speed with Tox development.

##GSoC

For the 2nd year in a row, [Tox got accepted in to GSoC](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/tox). This is great news and will both help new students learn about and start contributing to open source, and help Tox developers improve our projects and advance our goals of making security mainstream.

Want to contribute to Tox in GSoC but you're not a C/C++ developer? Tox has plenty of projects like ToxMe improvements in Python, Tox for Windows in C#, iOS and Android clients in Java/Objective C that you might enjoy. You can checkout our full list of ideas [here](http://wiki.tox.im/GSoC/2015/Ideas).

Ready to jump in and contribute to Tox? The deadline to write and submit a proposal for GSoC ends in a week but we encourage you to run it by us in [#tox-gsoc-students](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23tox-gsoc-students) for review so we can help you improve it.

##Translations

Want to contribute to Tox and speak another language? Localization and being able to ensure Tox is accessible to as many people as possible is something we pride in, but not something we can do alone. Localization in Tox and our sites depends on our community and bilingual Toxers like you taking the time to submit and review translations, and is something we greatly appreciate.

If you want to spend a few minutes becoming a translator or reviewer for our new site signup [here](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tox-website-next), if you want we can also let you know of other things needing translations too.

##Toxcore

The new API for toxcore mentioned in our last post is almost complete and almost ready to be merged, if you work on a client/wrapper/tool over Tox we encourage you to start porting your applications now. The new API is [here](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/new_api/toxcore/tox.h)

##Git mirror

We now maintain a Git mirror of popular Tox repositories for archive reasons, located at [git.tox.im](https://git.tox.im). The mirror is powered by our fork of [Gogs](http://gogs.io) and can be used as a personal code host if you'd like. Being a personal/non Github host isn't our main goal, but we don't prohibit it and a couple users/contributors have started using it as such.
