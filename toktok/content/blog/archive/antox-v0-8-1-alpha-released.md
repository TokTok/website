A new version of Antox has been released with the following changes:

- Filter the friends list by groups e.g. Online, Offline.
- You can now block friends so that you no longer receive messages or friend requests from them. As well as this, neither of you will see each other come online.
- Friends can now be added using the Tox DNS Discovery Version 1 and Version 2\. For more information, see the [STS](https://blog.libtoxcore.so/182/introducing-sts-single-tox-standard). This is a very technical feature at the moment but in the feature it will mean you can add each other with usernames once some more things have been ironed out.
- You can manually set your language in the settings window should the default language picked for you by Android not suffice.
- A Russian translation has been added to Antox.
- Improved and more efficient backend to help reduce network connection issues
  **Still to come in new releases**

- Typing indicators and a welcome tour (I promised these in the last blog post)
- Ability to create custom groups which you can then assign friends to
  **Antox is now on F-Droid**

Since the last release, you can now get Antox on F-Droid by adding http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo to your repo list. To do this, go to 'Manage Repos' in F-Droid. These will only be updated with every major release (or when a bug is fixed) rather than with every slight change.
