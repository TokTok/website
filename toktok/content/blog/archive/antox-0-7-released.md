We've finally arrived at a new version of Antox after a period of slow development. With this release comes two new major features, as well as a myriad of small bug fixes and slight changes not worth mentioning.

**New Features**

1.  Your friends now have profiles, just long hold on them to access it. The profiles contain all your friend's information including a QR image of their Tox key for easier sharing amongst your social group.
2.  You can now give your friends nicknames/aliases to easier identify your friend. This can be set when adding them for the first time, and later updated in their profile. Clearing their alias altogether will return to displaying their Tox nickname.
**Upcoming Features in the Next Release**

1.  Typing indicators to show when your friends are writing to you. You'll also send a typing status to your friends. These indicators will be a setting so you can turn them off should you wish to do so.
2.  Manually set your language. Currently you will be shown translated strings automatically if they exist based upon your locale, however to give you more control a setting will also be added to let you change the language.
3.  Welcome Tour to show off all the Antox features and gently introduce new users to Tox itself.
4.  Continued effort like always to fix the disconnects and any crashes.
You can get the updated APKs as always from [here](http://download.tox.im)
