While PC usage is on the decline, mobile usage has skyrocketed

<!-- more -->

and will continue to skyrocket in the future. We've come to realize
that because of this we need to start working to support mobile
and mobile device users as best we can.

With [ToxCOIN](https://blog.tox.im/2015/04/01/introducing-toxcoin/) support having been recently
announced we realized progress was being made in the right direction,
but it wasn't enough. We realized that some people might still
want to use traditional Tox IDs and use mobile devices at the 
same time so we decided to take a step back from what we're used
to and look at what much of our mobile using audience is already doing.

We saw typical mobile users send short video clips, talk in groups,
message automatically without setup, but nothing would work for Tox.
That was, until we noticed someone send a cute little heart icon to
her friend to express a complex feeling.

We realized that if one little character could express a whole emotion,
a couple of them could express a Tox ID, and so emoji support was born.

Starting today, most of our clients now support fun and friendly emoji
in place of existing scary and frightening Tox IDs, be it uTox or Toxy
with more clients in the works.


Ready to try it out? lean back, open uTox Android, and punch in 
``🌔💡⭩⬃⚿🚧⟛⋏⩮🚍🛱💖🖭⚏⋻😇∁⤔ℐ⋜↷⚑⍕👫≧ℇ😇`` to join our always 
popular groupchat in style.
