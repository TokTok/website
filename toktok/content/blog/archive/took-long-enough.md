Now that it's <del>Friday</del> Saturday it's finally time to spoil the news that we've somehow managed to keep mostly secret.

Tox is once and for all Alpha. Yes, you heard correctly, Alpha. That's it, go home.

Kidding! We've got a _little bit more to share._

Right now when you want to download Tox you click on a button to a wiki page where you follow a confusing chart to find a bunch of builds for various clients, all squeezed together waiting for a click. You don't know what's better, you don't know what does what, and that's a serious issue.

First, we've introduced a single easy to use webpage. Those confusing charts? gone, just select your OS and be on your way. Remember all those clients when you went to past download Tox? The official client is now just Tox. We've gone ahead and chosen the best client for each OS and made it Tox. If you're used to using builds of other clients or want to try something new don't be disheartened, we'll still be providing builds for all the clients so you can test to your hearts extent.

Having trouble with Tox? soon you'll be able to go to our new support site, choose your issue, and have an answer. Still confused? You'll also be able to punch in a question and get a response from a real live human as soon as we can. Say you find a bug, maybe you have a suggestion. Soon you'll be able to make bug report for Tox, make a suggestion, or just tell us how you feel, and it'll be sent to the respective support personnel and developers who'll do what they can to see to it that your bug is resolved as soon as we can.

And what you've all been waiting for, Tox for Windows, OS X, and Linux all have calling, and Tox for Windows has video! Video should be arriving soon for OS X as it's currently just broken due to a bug, and Linux is being worked on as we speak.
