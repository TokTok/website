An update to Antox has been released to the Google Play Alpha Testing group. This update includes notifications, a redesigned ActionBar, new launcher icon, and various other changes such as storing all Tox data on internal storage, rather than the SD card if one existed.

Changes:

- Icon updated
- ActivityBar now a dark blue/green
- Option to clear chat after deleting a user from the friend list
- Notifications of messages when not in app
- Moved QR code and Tox datafile to internal storage
- QR codes are now checked to ensure they match your Tox ID (previously, if you uninstalled, and then reinstalled Antox, your Tox ID change but your QR code wouldn't have updated. This change fixes that)
- Alert user if there is no network connection
- Verify the connection to the bootstrap server is completed upon startup.
- Chat messaging debugged heavily
  The updated APK will take a while to propagate through the Google servers but you should be receiving it shortly. As always, if you find a bug please report it on the Github issues page so it can be fixed. Please submit Google crash reports as well when possible.
