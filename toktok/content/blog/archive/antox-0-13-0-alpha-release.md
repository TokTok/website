Another day another release. This release is probably the biggest in the recent past and there's some screenshots to go along with it.

The Login activity has been changed to be given a nice background. Also, instead of having to write the name of your profile, the text box has been swapped for a dropdown list of all the profiles you have created to make logging in a much simpler and quicker process.

The Create Account activity has also been changed to be given a nice looking background. The weird looking checkbox from before has been turned into an incognito button.

The last design change to take place was to the friend requests. You can now accept and reject them right from the contacts list so you don't have to bring in the new pane or long hold on them.

Non-design wise, there have been various crash fixes. The app will also wake the CPU when doing network activity to try and keep you online over extended periods of time, and most importantly, you can now send any file in a file transfer, not just attach an image. Lastly, changing the app's language will no longer require a restart.


Edit: A couple more things that I forgot I implemented since the last release. The app now comes with Wi-Fi only enabled by default and you can turn this off in the settings if you want to use your mobile connection as well as Wi-Fi. Also, the app comes with TCP only by default which uses less battery and less data (about 50-100mb a day) at the expense of slower file transfers and slightly slower times for friend requests to go through. To speed things up, you can enabled UDP in the settings.
