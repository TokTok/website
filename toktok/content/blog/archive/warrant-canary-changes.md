While moving the wiki frontend a week ago we managed to forget to move it after changing the IP. This resulted in it being down for around a week.

We apologize for making this mistake, and have not been contacted by {3 letter agency}.

In addition to this, the canary is now located at [https://wiki.tox.im/canary.html](https://wiki.tox.im/canary.html)

It is also pgp signed with the build system key at [https://wiki.tox.im/canary.asc](https://wiki.tox.im/canary.html)
