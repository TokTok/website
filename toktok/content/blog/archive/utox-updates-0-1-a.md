The major update this week is the new groupchats that should work much better (connection wise) than the old ones. Note that as of now they are still missing important features like usernames but the base of them (joining/quitting/sending messages) should already work well.

As for uTox, mainly bug/translation fixes.

Also, I will be pushing updates in a more regular manner until group chats work well.
