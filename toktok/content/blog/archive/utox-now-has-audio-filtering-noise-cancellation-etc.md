To turn it on, the dropdown is right beside the audio input settings in uTox. You can preview your filtered (or not) audio by clicking on the preview button.

Currently noise reduction and gain control are properly implemented.

This is what it uses to filter the audio: [github repo here](https://github.com/irungentoo/filter_audio "filter_audio") I put it in its own repo so other clients can easily add it too.

I really would like to know how well it performs so please try it out and tell us.
