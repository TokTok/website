You can now finally get up to date Antox releases on the [Tox Downloads](http://wiki.tox.im/binaries) page. These APKs are updated automagically every time there's a change to Antox or the Tox core, which is usually several times a day.

This comes just in time as unfortunately we've had to pull Antox from the Google Play Store Alpha. This is due to a technical mishap with our key signing. Check back here and the current Google+ group for more news on how we fix this.

Lastly as a small note, you can now get bitcoins for your commits to Antox thanks to anonymous doners on [tip4commit](http://tip4commit.com/projects/654).
