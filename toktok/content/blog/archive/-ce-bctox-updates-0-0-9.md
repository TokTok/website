I will now be writing a blog post for every weekly μTox update, including a list of new features and bug fixes. This week's update includes:

**New features:**

- Experimental Android support, includes audio calling. Get the .apk [[here]](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/uTox_android/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/future.apk)
  **Bugfixes:**

- Fixed inline PNGs having red/blue channels swapped when saved
- Shift+HOME/END in text boxes now behaves correctly
  **Other:**

- The core A/V protocol has changed: A/V is not compatible with older versions of uTox
- Update 0.0.8 introduced a new major feature, allowing uTox users select a section of their desktop and send it as an inline image
- Some people have been asking how the μTox updater for Windows works. You can read about how it works [[here]](https://github.com/notsecure/utox-update)
- Jenkins now builds 32-bit builds of uTox for Linux
- uTox for Linux no longer relies on Xft, instead it uses Freetype directly
- uTox for Linux now has a --version command
