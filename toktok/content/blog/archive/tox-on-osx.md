Hodwy folks,

After 27 whole days of delay our Tox downloads for OS X work again, and are better than ever!

We ran them previously, but progress on clients stagnated and we couldn't justify the extra cost to build binaries that didn't really work.
<!-- more -->
Now that qTox works great on OS X we've continued our builds for all our OS X users, you can download them [here](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries#OS_X "here").

Happy Toxing!
