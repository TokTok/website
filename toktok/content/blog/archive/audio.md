Last night, a non-gui client was given audio support: Toxic!

What does this mean? Well for starters toxic is the CLI client, meaning it's all done in console, so not that many people will be using it. That said, it's the first real implementation of the audio/video features worked on by mannol and Martijnvdc, with mannol putting audio functionality inside of Toxic as well.

It took a while for one client to do it, but after this we expect more clients to add support, with an example to go off of. Be warned though, Toxic is buggy right now, and is subject to crashing. This goes along with a daily reminder that Tox is still pre-alpha, but making strides!
