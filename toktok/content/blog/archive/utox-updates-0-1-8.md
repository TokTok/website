What's new: Save file location changed, bug fixes, bug fixes, new translations and some small features like the icon on Windows changing colour when a message is received.

For credits and a detailed list of all changes: [https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master](https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master "https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master")

The main change in this update and why I made this post is that uTox now saves to roaming appdata instead of local appdata which should lead to less people losing their saves. uTox should automatically load the save from its previous location meaning you don't have to move it there yourself. What you should do that uTox doesn't do is remove the old location.

Also, if anyone isn't aware of this yet, I will be the one maintaining uTox from now on until notsecure is less busy.

Expect something bigger next week.
