As Tox grows and more clients are created, we feel it is time to create a Tox standard. Doing so will enable us to promote a single, cohesive brand despite the numerous clients. STS aims to offer a handbook for existing and potential client developers to follow so they can all remain consistent, yet unique in their own way. Terminology such as the **Tox ID** will represent the 76-character string used to identify users, but **Nickname **and **Names** being used to personally recognize friends. This will prevent confusion for users who wish to switch clients, and allow Tox to focus on pushing a single brand. At the moment, we are **strongly recommending** adherence to the STS, as it will foster a more productive environment, but we recognize that it's the right of the developer to chose. Once the STS has been completed and v1.0.0 has been published, we will no longer offer support or publicity to clients that wish to deviate from the STS. We regret that we must take such a stance, but it is required that we take such measures in order to uphold one of Tox's foremost goals: to provide a smooth and easy experience for all walks of life.

Like everything Tox does, the Single Tox Standard is on GitHub where you may open tickets to address concerns, questions, or offer feedback. Your continued support of Tox is appreciated as we draft the first version of STS.
