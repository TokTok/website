irungentoo has merged the TCP branch he has been long working on today, which now enabled those behind restrictive NATs access to TCP relays in order to connect with other users. Most of the changes were backend, which means not much is required to update existing clients, but be aware that old clients will no longer work with new clients.

Expect a detailed post about all the changes soon.
