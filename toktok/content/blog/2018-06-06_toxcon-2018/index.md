In October the Tox developer community will be holding a conference in
Vienna. Join us as we talk about the progress we have made during the
last 12 months with Tox and other security related topics. There will be
lots of talks and other cool things to see.

[\#toxcon2018](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#toxcon2018) IRC
channel on Freenode and contact _robinli_, _sudden6_ or _zoff99_.

More information will be revealed in a future post.
